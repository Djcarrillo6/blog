### Project Ideas With Home Cloud Cluster

## Distributed Machine Learning
- Train a machine learning model in a distributed fashion across the cluster nodes, leveraging the combined compute power. [1][2][3]

## Edge Computing Platform
- Deploy a lightweight edge computing platform like KubeEdge or K3s to run containerized applications closer to IoT devices and sensors. [4][5]
- Develop IoT applications that collect data from connected devices and process it on the edge cluster. [4][5]

## Serverless Functions
- Set up a serverless functions platform like OpenFaaS or Knative on your cluster. [4]
- Build event-driven, scalable microservices that can be triggered by various inputs like HTTP requests, IoT sensor data, or scheduled events. [4]

## Embedded Systems Development
- Use the cluster to build, test, and deploy embedded software written in Rust, Zig, C++, or C for IoT devices and edge hardware. [1][2][3][4]
- Integrate the cluster with hardware prototyping boards like Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, or RISC-V boards to create end-to-end embedded systems. [1][2][3][4]

## Continuous Integration/Deployment
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build, test, and deploy your software projects to the Kubernetes cluster. [1][2][3][4][5]
- Experiment with tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate your development workflows. [1][2][3][4][5]

## Distributed Storage
- Implement a distributed storage solution like Ceph or Rook-Ceph on your cluster to provide highly available and scalable storage for your applications. [3][4]
- Explore using the cluster's storage for backup, archiving, or content delivery use cases. [3][4]

## Networking and Security
- Configure advanced networking features like load balancing, service mesh, or network policy enforcement on your cluster. [4][5]
- Explore security-focused projects like Istio, Linkerd, or Falco to enhance the security and observability of your cluster. [4][5]
