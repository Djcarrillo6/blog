# Raspberry Pi Cluster Linux Networking Project Ideas


## ----- Distributed Network Traffic Analyzer -----

### Detailed Project Description

#### Objective
Create a distributed system across a Raspberry Pi cluster to monitor and analyze network traffic, providing insights into traffic patterns, performance issues, and potential security threats.


#### Tools and Technologies
- **Wireshark**: For capturing and analyzing packets.
- **Elastic Stack**:
  - **Elasticsearch**: For storing and searching data.
  - **Logstash**: For processing and sending data to Elasticsearch.
  - **Kibana**: For visualizing data from Elasticsearch.


### Installation and Configuration Steps on Ubuntu Server

#### 1. **Install Necessary Tools**:
 - Update your system and install required packages, explaining what each package is for:
  
  **Update Package List**:
  ```bash
    sudo apt update
  ```
  
  **Install Wireshark**:
  - Wireshark is used for capturing and analyzing network packets.
  ```bash
    sudo apt install wireshark
  ```
  - After installation, configure Wireshark to allow non-root users to capture packets:
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure wireshark-common
    sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER
  ```
  
  **Install Elasticsearch**:
  - Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. It stores and indexes data for searching, analyzing, and visualizing in real-time.
  ```bash
    sudo apt install elasticsearch
  ```
  - Post-installation, configure Elasticsearch settings such as network settings to bind to your private network:
  ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
  ```
  - Adjust the `network.host` to your server's IP address and possibly configure the cluster and node settings based on your cluster's design.
  
  **Install Logstash**:
  - Logstash is used for processing incoming data and forwarding it to Elasticsearch.
  ```bash
    sudo apt install logstash
  ```
  - After installation, create a configuration file for Logstash to define input, filter, and output settings:
  ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf
  ```
  
  **Install Kibana**:
  - Kibana is a visualization layer that works on top of Elasticsearch, providing a user interface for visualizing the data stored in Elasticsearch.
  ```bash
    sudo apt install kibana
  ```
  - Configure Kibana by setting the Elasticsearch URL and adjusting the server's host in the Kibana configuration file:
  ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
  ```

#### 2. **Service Management with Systemd**:
 - Start and enable services to ensure they run on boot:
   ```bash
    sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
    sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
    sudo systemctl start logstash
    sudo systemctl enable logstash
    sudo systemctl start kibana
    sudo systemctl enable kibana
   ```

#### 3. **Security with UFW**:
 - Set up and manage firewall rules using `ufw` to ensure only authorized access to service ports:
   ```bash
    sudo ufw enable
    sudo ufw allow from any to any port 5601 proto tcp # Kibana
    sudo ufw allow from any to any port 9200 proto tcp # Elasticsearch
    sudo ufw allow from any to any port 5044 proto tcp # Logstash
   ```

#### 4. **Automation with Ansible**:
 - Deploy configurations and manage nodes with Ansible:
   - Create Ansible playbooks to automate the installation and configuration of the network monitoring tools across all Raspberry Pi nodes. This playbook can manage package installation, configuration file updates, and service handling.

### Documentation
  - **Document every step of the process**, from installation to configuration. Include notes on why each setting was chosen and how it fits into the overall architecture.
  - **Maintain a GitHub repository** for your configurations and playbooks, which will serve as an excellent reference and portfolio piece for potential employers or collaborators.


#### Sections
1. **Network Capture Configuration**:
   - Set up each Raspberry Pi to capture traffic using `tcpdump` or Wireshark.
   - Configure network interfaces for promiscuous mode to ensure all traffic is captured.

2. **Data Processing with Logstash**:
   - Install Logstash on each node.
   - Configure Logstash to parse and enrich the captured data before sending it to Elasticsearch.

3. **Data Storage with Elasticsearch**:
   - Deploy Elasticsearch in the cluster, configuring it for high availability and resilience.
   - Ensure data is indexed properly for efficient querying and analysis.

4. **Visualization with Kibana**:
   - Set up Kibana to connect to Elasticsearch.
   - Create dashboards to visualize and analyze the traffic data in real-time.

5. **Automation and Scripting**:
   - Write scripts for automated deployment and configuration of the monitoring tools.
   - Use Ansible or similar tools to manage configurations across the cluster.


### High-Level Guide
1. **Setup and Configuration**:
   - Install necessary tools on each node.
   - Configure network interfaces and ensure each node can capture traffic.

2. **Implementing Logstash Pipelines**:
   - Define filters and outputs in Logstash to process the data according to your analysis needs.

3. **Deploying Elasticsearch**:
   - Set up Elasticsearch with the necessary cluster settings for your hardware and data requirements.

4. **Building Dashboards**:
   - Use Kibana to create dashboards that help visualize network metrics and alerts based on the data received.

5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Test the system thoroughly to ensure data flows correctly and dashboards reflect real-time data.
   - Optimize configurations for better performance and accuracy.

6. **Documentation and Maintenance**:
   - Document the architecture, configuration, and setup procedures.
   - Establish a routine for maintaining and updating the system.


### Outcome
The final outcome is a reliable, efficient, and resilient distributed network traffic analyzer that provides insights into network traffic patterns, performance issues, and potential security threats. This setup demonstrates your ability to design and implement complex network solutions.
