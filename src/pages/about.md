## A Little About Me

Hi! I'm David Carrillo Jr., a software engineer residing in the vibrant heart of Southern California. I embarked on my professional tech journey in 2019, starting as a front-end web developer. I remember crafting my first HTML/CSS website in 7th grade - the moment when my code sprung to life on an Internet Explorer window steered me towards my profound passion for programming. My aim with this blog is to share what I continue to learn, showcase what I'm creating, and provide insights into my experiences in the ever-evolving tech industry.

## Before I Became An Engineer

Before jumping into the tech world, I was immersed in hospitality from 2009 to 2019, playing different roles ranging from server and bartender to manager and sommelier. Over this decade-long stint, I honed a robust skill set grounded in delivering exceptional customer experiences. I mastered the art of anticipating customer needs, handling high-pressure situations, effectively communicating within a diverse team, and building substantial relationships with clients. All these experiences taught me the significance of advocating for customers and working collaboratively with my team to formulate solutions. After a rewarding 10 years in hospitality, an unquenchable thirst for a fresh challenge led me to tech. Knowing there was a different arena where I could unveil the unique application of my skills excited me.

## Habbits & Hobbies

Away from my professional pursuits, you'll likely find me delving into the latest tech trends, acquiring new software skills, building apps, or immersed in the world of video games. Enthralling as these may be, nothing excites me more than sports gambling - I find immense thrill in constructing software specifically designed to empower analytic-driven gamblers. My love for sports doesn't end with simply being a spectator - I revel in creating apps and programs that explore the intersection of sports and technology.
